Sprite settings in Unity

All sprites imported should have the same settigns applied. This will give us consistent scaling for the pixels as well as color matching. 

Note: colors will not necessarily match intended colors exactly. What's important is that they are matched A) in the design program (Photoshop) and B) in Unity after import.

Settings to CHANGE:

Pixels Per Unit: 16
Filter Mode: Point (no filter)
